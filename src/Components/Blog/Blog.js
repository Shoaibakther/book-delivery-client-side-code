                <h2>Book Summaries:
                    <br /> Popular Books Summarized in 3 Sentences or Less</h2>
                <p>This page shares a full list of book summaries I have compiled during my reading and research. I have tried to summarize each book on this page in just three sentences, which I think is a fun way to distill the main ideas of the book. If a particular book sounds interesting to you, click on the full book summary and you can browse all of my notes on it. <br /> <br />

These book summaries are not organized by category, so you might find a self-help book followed by a business book followed by a psychology book. If you would like to browse my book suggestions for a particular category, then check out my reading list instead.</p>

                <h3>10% Happier by Dan Harris</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: Practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you at least 10 percent happier. Being mindful doesn’t change the problems in your life, but mindfulness does help you respond to your problems rather than react to them. Mindfulness helps you realize that striving for success is fine as long as you accept that the outcome is outside your control.</p>

                <h3>
The 10X Rule by Grant Cardone</h3>
<p>The Book in Three Sentences: The 10X Rule says that 1) you should set targets for yourself that are 10X greater than what you believe you can achieve and 2) you should take actions that are 10X greater than what you believe are necessary to achieve your goals. The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough. Taking massive action is the only way to fulfill your true potential.</p>

                <h3>A Short Guide to a Happy Life by Anna Quindlen by Anna Quindlen</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: The only thing you have that nobody else has is control of your life. The hardest thing of all is to learn to love the journey, not the destination. Get a real life rather than frantically chasing the next level of success.</p>

                <h3>A Technique for Producing Ideas by James Webb Young</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: An idea occurs when you develop a new combination of old elements. The capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on your ability to see relationships. All ideas follow a five-step process of 1) gathering material, 2) intensely working over the material in your mind, 3) stepping away from the problem, 4) allowing the idea to come back to you naturally, and 5) testing your idea in the real world and adjusting it based on feedback.</p>

                <h3>
Adapt by Tim Harford</h3>
<p>The Book in Three Sentences: Seek out new ideas and try new things. When trying something new, do it on a scale where failure is survivable. Seek out feedback and learn from your mistakes as you go along.</p>

                <h3>Anything You Want by Derek Sivers</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: Too many people spend their life pursuing things that don’t actually make them happy. When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you create all the laws. Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</p>

                <h3>Are You Fully Charged? by Tom Rath</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: There are three keys to being fully charged each day: doing work that provides meaning to your life, having positive social interactions with others, and taking care of yourself so you have the energy you need to do the first two things. Trying to maximize your own happiness can actually make you feel self-absorbed and lonely, but giving more can drive meaning and happiness in your life. People who spend money on experiences are happier than those who spend on material things.</p>

                <h3>The Art of Possibility by Rosamund Zander and Benjamin Zander</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: Everything in life is an invention. If you choose to look at your life in a new way, then suddenly your problems fade away. One of the best ways to do this is to focus on the possibilities surrounding you in any situation rather than slipping into the default mode of measuring and comparing your life to others.</p>

                <h3>The Art of Profitability by Adrian Slywotzky</h3>
                <p>The Book in Three Sentences: There are many ways to make profit and it is unlikely that your business does all of them. People will pay different prices for the same thing in different situations (think: Coke in the grocery store vs. Coke in a nice restaurant). Good profit models are easy to brainstorm and hard to execute.</p>
