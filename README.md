# Book library website with Create React-Router App

Book is a widely-known word with a whole lot of less well-known meanings. The noun book can refer to a bunch of pages bound together, as in a book you read, but also a book of tickets or stamps, a section of a larger work of literature (like a book of the Bible), or the written script of a stage play. Book can also be a verb meaning "to record information about a criminal suspect" or "to reserve," which you could use to say, "Let's book a room at the nicest hotel in Maui this winter."
